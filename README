The Automated Resume Parser is a Python-based project that extracts and categorizes key information (such as Name, Skills, and Education) from uploaded resumes (PDF files).
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to read resumes, identify relevant information, and store the extracted data in a CSV file for further analysis.
